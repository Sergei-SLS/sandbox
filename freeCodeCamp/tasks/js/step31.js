// Step 31
// Declaring a variable with the let keyword allows it to be reassigned. This means you could change character later to be a completely different value.

// For this project, you will not want to change these variable values. So instead, you should use const to declare them. const variables are special.

// First, a const variable cannot be reassigned like a let variable.

// Replace your let keywords with const.

const character = "Hello";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];
